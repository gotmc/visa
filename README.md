## Background

The primary purpose of this package is to parse a VISA resource address
string in order to create a new VISA resource, which abstracts the
interface typeâ€”USBTMC, TCPIP, ASRL. By registering a driver for the
interface type, application developers can decide which interface types
to support and which to exclude, so as to not unnecessarily bloat their
packages.

The primary source of information is the *VPP-4.3: The VISA Library*
dated June 19, 2014, which can be found at the [IVI Specifications
webpage][ivi-specs].

## Usage

In order to not bloat an end developer's application, the desired HW interface
driver(s) have to be registered, similar to Go's SQL package. Currently, there
are TCPIP, USBTMC, and Serial (ASRL) drivers available.

```go
